/// This function accepts a binary contract as input and employs a set of heuristics
/// to identify the contract's source language. It currently supports detection of the
/// ink! and Solidity languages.
///
/// # Developer Note
///
/// Finding a heuristic to distinguish ink! bytecode vs Solidity bytecode is tricky.
/// This is because the Rust compiler (ink!) compiles to LLVM IR, which is the
/// compiled to RISC-V. The Parity `resolc` compiler compiles Yul to LLVM IR,
/// which is then compiled to RISC-V. So in both cases the IR is already LLVM.
///
/// The heuristic that we have found to work is that _all_ Solidity binaries always
/// have these two imports following each other: `seal_return`, `set_immutable_data`.
/// This is true, even for read-only contracts that never store anything.
///
/// For ink!, we found that _all_ binaries have these two imports right after each
/// other: `seal_return`, `set_storage`. This is also true for read-only contracts.
///
/// Note: It is unclear to us at this moment why both languages compile `set_*`
/// imports into the binary, even if no mutation operations are in the syntax.
